# Exploring Pre-Trained Language Models to Build Knowledge Graph for Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs)
Data and Jupyter notebooks of the paper: Exploring Pre-Trained Language Models to Build
Knowledge Graph for Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs)

## Introduction
Prompt-Design on Pre-trained large Language Models (prompt-design\&PLM) has become an emerging paradigm for a range of NLP tasks.
Although an increased effort has been put into reformulating many classic NLP problems as prompt-based learning, 
less explored areas include knowledge graph construction from PLMs.

## Structure
- data: the csv files containing the triples for constructing the MOF knowledge grpah (MOF-KG).
- src: the Jupyter notebooks for probing general and domain specific language models.
